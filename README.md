# ArrayList-Heap-Overflow
Write a program in either C++ or Java that dynamically allocates a number of very large integer arrays. Either increase the number of dynamically allocated arrays or increase the size of each array until an exception is generated. The operating system should generate a hardware interrupt when the amount of user addressable space has been exhausted. Both C++ and Java should pass this interrupt on as an exception. How much memory was used before the exception was generated? You can calculate the number of bytes by multiplying the sizeof(int) times the total number of integers requested. Is running out of heap memory an exploitable vulnerability?
